# Minesweeper

Do you like puzzles, explosions and fun? Then you will love this minesweeper game that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my bootcamp project. It is a modern twist on the classic Windows game, with some extra features and challenges to spice things up.

## Features

- A grid of tiles that hide mines and numbers
- Left-click on a tile to reveal it
- Right-click on a tile to flag it as a mine
- If you reveal a mine, you lose a life
- If you lose all your lives, you lose the game
- If you flag all the mines correctly, you win the game
- You can choose the size of the grid and the number of mines
- You can also hand place the mines before starting the game
- You have three hints that you can use to reveal a random tile
- The game tracks your time and score
